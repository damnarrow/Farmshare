        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h2>What is a CSA?</h2>
        <p>
        The CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) model has been developing
        over the past 20 or so years as one of the many means of creating a 
        food production and distribution model that is healthy and sustainable 
        for people, the economy and the environment. While there are about as 
        many ways of doing a CSA as there are CSAs, the basic model involves 
        a group of people buying shares in the seasonal output of a local farm, 
        usually at a discounted rate, and in return receiving weekly drop-offs
        of the farm?s product through the entire growing season.
        </p>
        <h2>How does a CSA work?</h2>
        <p>
            Members of the CSA purchase a full or half share of vegetables, 
            which they pick up at a distribution site once a week. The season 
            is 20 weeks long, begins around June and ends around October. 
            Members receive a weekly box of their share of produce, a full 
            share amounting to about enough vegetables to get fresh veggies 
            into the diets of a family of four for the week. For a smaller 
            family, it would mean vegetable-based meals for the week. While 
            the shares are generally set, if someone really does not like 
            eggplant, for example, they can tell our farmer and he will try 
            his best to substitute it with something of a similar value.<br />
            <br/>
            During weekly pickup, some of the produce is weighed and 
            distributed mixed in a box (see pictured) and you take the 
            contents from one box. Additionally, other produce is distributed
            by units instead of weight and so is ?self serve,? meaning that 
            you select (usually 1-3 units) your items from various other boxes.
            <br/><br/>
            In addition to vegetables, the following add-ons are also available
            for an additional fee: Eggs, Extra fruit (stone fruit including 
            peaches, pears, apples, plums), and Jarred goods (honey, pickles, 
            tomato sauce)
        </p>

        <h2>Where is the weekly pick-up location?</h2>
        <p>
        This year, weekly pick-up is at Flatbush-Tompkins Congregational Church,
        at East 18th and Dorchester.
        </p>

        <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
