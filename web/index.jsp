    <h1>Welcome to Brookyln's Farm Share CSA!</h1>

    <p>
        The CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) model has been developing 
        over the past 20 or so years as one of the many means of creating a 
        food production and distribution model that is healthy and sustainable 
        for people, the economy and the environment. While there are about as
        many ways of doing a CSA as there are CSAs, the basic model involves 
        a group of people buying shares in the seasonal output of a local
        farm, usually at a discounted rate, and in return receiving weekly 
        drop-offs of the farm?s product through the entire growing season.

    <p>You can either become a member for the season and get farm fresh
    vegetables and fruit weekly, or you can order items weekly from the farm
    and pick it up during farm share distribution hours.</p>
